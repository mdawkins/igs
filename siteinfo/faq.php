ANSWERS TO FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</font><br><br>

<font class=dark_large>Why have I not received a Tracking Number for my order?</font><br>
Within 24 hours, we email a tracking number to those who have placed an order. If you haven't received this information, you are welcome to call. Some emails have been undeliverable because of the increased "security options" that you can place on your email account to help prevent unwanted spam. Though we are not spamming, we are still prevented from sending you a tracking number if you have these features in place.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>How do I use your site?</font><br>
The brand names of the lines we carry are listed to the left of our home
page. Click on any of them to see the categories of that line. Click on
any category to see pictures of products. If you click on the picture,
more details (including information about the product being instock) will
show as well as a larger image of the item.<br><br>

Don't forget to click on the next page of products. Our site handles 12
pictures per page. If there are more than 12 products in a category, look
near the top and/or bottom of the page for more page numbers. Click on the next page
number to see more products. <br>

<font class=dark_large>How can I tell about the availability of an item?</font><br>
Click on the image to see a larger image and the availability details will
also show.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>Definitions of each availability term:</font><br>
<font class=dark_med>Instock:</font> This means that the item should be 
in our physical inventory at the shop. Many times during the day, we manually update the instock items.
It is possible that an item was recently sold and has not yet been
taken off the site. When we sell the last of an item, sometimes we do not
show it on our site until it is back instock again.<br><br>

<font class=dark_med>On Order:</font> This means that an item is currently 
on order with a manufacturer. Under most circumstances, it will arrive within 2 days to 4
weeks. We do not always know when the item will be instock again. We can
let you know an estimated time that we will have it. We rely on the
manufacturer to provide us with correct information.<br><br>

<font class=dark_med>Direct Ship:</font> We have access to more products 
than we stock. Therefore, we offer more of a selection on our web site than we can physically stock at
our shop.  The companies we deal with are quick and reliable. They stock a wide selection of what they manufacturer. Rarely does the manufacturer not have an item instock. We are authorized to simply call them and have the item  shipped directly to you. Depending on the time of year, these companies can have an item shipped within a day to a week. Each company operates differently. Please contact us if you have a deadline and we can let you know when you could expect the
item.<br><br>

<font class=dark_med>Pre-Order:</font> The item is new, and we do not have a 
specific date of arrival. We will process your order for the item after we receive the new item. We
will not charge your credit card until the item is ready to ship to you.
Sometimes, a pre-ordered item can take up to 2 months. We will notify you by email when your order has shipped.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>Can I order more than 1 of the same item?</font><br>
Yes.  We may or may not have more than one of any individual item, but we
will quickly notify you by email if we cannot fulfill your order. We will
not process incomplete orders without approval from you.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>How long does it take to process my order?</font><br>
We usually process an order within hours after you submit it. We will
notify you within 24 hours by email about the status of your order. This
will usually be a confirmation email with the title "Tracking Number for
Order <?php echo $SITENAME; ?>." We will include a Fed Ex tracking number for
you.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>How much is shipping?</font><br>
Shipping is FREE if your order is $90 or more being shipped to one
address.  For orders under $90, the shipping is a flat $8.99.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>When will you ship my order?</font><br>
We ship Monday through Friday via Fed Ex Ground. Fed Ex usually picks up
packages from us at 12 NOON Mountain Time. During the Holiday Season, they
may pick up as late as 4:00 PM. We try to pack you order to go out as
quickly as possible. Most orders are shipped the day we receive them!<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>Can I get an order shipped by the next day?</font><br>
Yes. It usually starts at a $50 rate for a package to be shipped over
night with Fed Ex. We cannot have some items shipped this way. Please call
us and we can help you.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>Can I get my order gift wrapped?</font><br>
Yes. We have Christmas and birthday gift wrapping available at $6 per
item.  We are not able to wrap some larger items, or items that are being
shipped directly from the manufacturer.  Within our  "Special
Instructions" box (shown at check out) please tell us the item(s) that
you want gift wrapped and the occasion.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>Can I have an order shipped to someone else's address?</font><br>
Yes. You can have a package shipped to your work, a loved one, or a
friend's address.  After you fill in your information, you will be given a
page for the shipping address.  If you send the package to someone else's
name, we will mail you the receipt. Your friend will not have a price
included anywhere with your gift. (If it is addressed in YOUR name, and
going to a different address, we will include the receipt in the box.)<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>Can I have the package shipped internationally?</font><br>
Sorry, we no longer ship internationally. <br><br>

<font class=dark_large>How can I get the best results using your search feature?</font><br>
You may search for titles of pieces, or subjects. Your search will show
those products which contain the word(s) anywhere in the category, or
title, or description of the item(s). Do not use punctuation marks of any
kind when requesting a search.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>Do you offer other brand names in your store which are not pictured on your site?</font><br>
Yes. We also carry: J Leen Crystal, Swarovski Jewelry, Swarovski Crystal Moments, My Little Kitchen Fairies, Fairy Divas by Amy Brown, Willow Tree by Susan Lordi, and Clothtique Santas by Possible Dreams. Eventually, we plan to make these lines available to order online. For now, you are welcome to call.<br><br>

<font class=dark_large>I can't submit my order, what should I do?</font><br>
Call our toll free number: 1.800.735.4438. We can take your order by
phone. Also, please check to see if you created a username and password on
our check out page. If you haven't done this, the system cannot process
your order. If you did this, and are still having problems, please let us
know the nature of the problem and we will investigate.<br><br>
